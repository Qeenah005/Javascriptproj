  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">What is JavaScript</h2>
  <p style=" font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center;">JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It is Object-Based Language, needs to be integrated into an HTML
    program for execution.
    It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.
    After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued
    to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).
    Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).

    ES2 ECMAScript 2 was released in 1998 with Netscape 42 and JavaScript 1.3 and IE 5 was the
    first browser to support ES2 in 1999 while ECMAScript 3 was released too <br>
    ES3 IE 5.5 was the first browser to support ES3 with Netscape 62 and was released with JavaScript 1.5
    in 2000 together with Firefox 1 <br>
    ES4 ECMAScript 4 was abandoned afet been released in 2008 <br>

          Java is a Programming language <br>
          Java is a pure Object Oriented Programming Language <br>
          Java is a Standalone language <br>
          Java programming language was developed by the " Sun Microsystems" <br>
          Java programming language, programs are saved with the ".java" extension <br>
          Java requires a large amount of memory <br>
          Java is stored on the host machine as the "Byte" code

        <p style=" font-size:20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">JavaScript is a scripting language.
          JavaScript is Object-Based Language. <br>
          JavaScript is not a standalone language, as it needs to be integrated into an
          "HTML program for execution". <br>
          JavaScript programming language was developed by the "Netscape." <br>
          JavaScript language programs are saved with the ".js" extension <br>
          JavaScript does not require that amount of memory <br>
          JavaScript is stored on the Host machine (client Machine) as the "source" text. <br>

  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Difference between "var", "let", and "const" </h2>
  <p style=" font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center;">
    The main difference between is in their scope and assignability. Variables declared with "var" have the
    function-level scope and can be reassigned and redeclared, while <strong style="color: black;">similarity:</strong>"let" and "const" variables have the block-level scope,
   "let" variables can be updated but not re-declared, but "const" variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
    Variables declared with const , just like let , are hoisted to the top of their global, local, or block scope â€“ without a default initialization. 
    var variables, are hoisted with a default value of undefined so they can be accessed before declaration without errors.
    <strong style="color: black;">similarity:</strong> var and let create variables that can be reassigned another value. const creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value
    var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while similarity let and const are block scoped.
    While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
